	v0.1+ (requirements for future development cycle(s), which came to mind early and may be useful to future proof the code)
	  RVx
	TOOLS
	  RTx ability to group parts together to create subassemblies
	  RTx ability to scale subassemblies and multiple parts concurrently but only in every direction at once to avoid transform issues
	  RTx ability to scale subassemblies and multiple parts concurrently in single axes if all are rectilinearly aligned
	  MIx saving of subassemblies (in a separate folder from regular models)
	  MIx loading of subassemblies
	  MIx saves must keep a version number in case of any possible breaking changes
	  RTx add resizealign https://github.com/stravant/roblox-resizealign/tree/main
	  RTx add properties tab for adjusting part values
	  RTx save and load material presets/collections, input either godot standardmaterials or godot shadermaterials, for the time being the available materials will not be adjustable (keep this in mind for the implementation)
	  RTx ability to lock parts (using lock tool or properties menu)
	  RTx ability to undo (ctrl + z) and redo (ctrl + y)
	  RTx user guide f1 or ?/help button
	  RTx possibly CSG operations for parts
