tartarus modelling tool


state machine for every drag tool state

this counts in every tool mode except paint and material spawn part


also, parts are dragged by the position at which theyve been clicked on
meaning:
the part will snap to the position on the surface that
the planar position that the mouse ray hit the surface of the part
so like
point 1: the point the mouse ray hit the selected part
point 2: the point the mouse ray hit the unselected part underneath
then the part will snap point 1 as close as possible to point 2 planar-ly


--------------------


gotta figure out how make handles
make class in similar manner to selection box
maybe a generic handle class that can create all types?
yea
