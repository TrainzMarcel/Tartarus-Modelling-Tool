tartarus modelling tool


state machine it is
(i was talking about tool state)

this counts in every tool mode except paint and material spawn part

r and t also count in these cases
r: will always rotate around the surface normal
t: will always rotate around the horizontal axis from the camera

also, parts are dragged by the position at which theyve been clicked on
meaning:
the part will snap to the position on the surface that
the planar position that the mouse ray hit the surface of the part
so like
point 1: the point the mouse ray hit the selected part
point 2: the point the mouse ray hit the unselected part underneath
then the part will snap point 1 as close as possible to point 2 planar-ly


--------------------


gotta figure out how make handles
make class in similar manner to selection box
maybe a generic handle class that can create all types?
yea
