take care of materials
	(use better shader)
	(add at least 5 for testing)

x make an icon for rotation pivot tool

implement undo/redo

clean up/segregate main into a higher level view
figure out what data can be hidden behind namespace facades
what data or variables can be segregated out of main and how far

reduce code duplication in snapping code

write code for: ctrl+z, +y
settings menu? dataloader settings csv?


import obj, gltf
export obj, gltf
export to godot project -> make sure all required materials are there -> find all instances of the previously exported meshes and replace them, recolor them the way they were colored before replacing

asset manager menus for color palette, material palette, part type palette (include default parts? checkbox)
	option to mass import things with visible parallel arrays (left to right for example albedo image files, then below another array which has the normal maps then below the material names, etc)

write instructions manual
