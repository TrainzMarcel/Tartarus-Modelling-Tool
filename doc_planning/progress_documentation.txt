11.7. started work on 3d level editor software
12.7. started to implemente spawning, dragging and visual selection of cuboids
17.7. finished implementing selection box

24.7. implementing dragging

2.10. returned to this project
3.10. renamed this project to tartarus modelling tool and uploaded this project and the flowcharting tool to github along with setting up git vcs
14.10. finished writing out requirements
18.10. selection system and selection boxes are working
21.10. selection system cleaned up
23.10. got crude rotation snapping done, brought in 3d vector arrows for easier debugging
25.10. fixed snap_rotation inconsistencies depending on surface normal
28.10. created unit_test.gd, removed drag_state, added rotation using r and t
6.11. moved dragging logic into update_snap(), added aabb calculation for determining size of selection
18.11. drag_offset became offset from raycast hit to dragged part, main_offset became offset from dragged part to rest of selection
20.11. refactored and cleaned up snap_position()
27.11. further improved snapping (odd/even offset) and moved lots of static functions into snap_utils.gd
5.12. updated readme
20.12. added shader to render handles on top, started work on transform_handle.gd, added collision layers to raycast functions
27.12. continued to roughly work out how to make transform handles work
8.1. figuring out projection of mouse movement onto transform handle axis
20.1. squashed bug when user tries to drag already selected part by holding shift, reorganized some code
22.1. replaced aabb with my own abb class to avoid having to rotate my data to fit the aabb and temporarily added a mesh representation
23.1. worked on studying better architecture for input() in the main class
24.1. removed state enum and changed out with array which contains each transformhandle, renamed some functions to make more sense, changed transformhandle code to work at any orientation, reorganized some functions into transformhandleutils
29.1. added a bunch of functionality to set the position and rotation of the transform tools, optimized functions in snap_utils to iterate through basis instead of redundant arrays
